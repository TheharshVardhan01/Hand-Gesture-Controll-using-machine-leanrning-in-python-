ðŸŽ® Hand Gesture Control System

Control your system's volume and media playback using just your hand gestures! This project combines computer vision, machine learning, and system automation to create an interactive and fun experience.

âœ¨ Features

Volume Control: Adjust your system's volume by moving your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart.

Play/Pause Media: Perform a pinch gesture (thumb and index finger touching) to toggle play/pause on your media player.

ðŸ—‚ How It Works

Hand Detection: Uses the MediaPipe Hands model to detect and track hand landmarks in real time.

Gesture Recognition: Measures the distance between key points on the hand (thumb and index finger) to determine the gesture.

Volume Mapping: Maps the finger distance to the system's volume range using PyCaw.

Media Control: Uses PyAutoGUI to simulate key presses for play/pause functionality.
